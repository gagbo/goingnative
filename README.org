#+TITLE: Native Addons and Github NPM publish tests

I advise against using this for any reason. I am using this repository to learn
and test :
- native addons writing / packaging
- publishing to NPM using automated github actions.

* Parts
** Goingnative-addon
This is a follow along of the nice goingnative tutorial to learn how to write
native addons for Node.

This also includes a package.json that tries to clamp the version of Node, since
the tutorial hasn't been updated to work with Node 12 at least.

** Github actions
Various publish actions using Github CI secrets are also tested to see how the
package can be deployed.
